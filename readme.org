* ALM014 FIZZLE GUTS

** Introduction

The ALM Busy Circuits 'Fizzle guts' is a Eurorack dual low pass filter
and VCA that uses a 'donor' filter MB87186 IC from a Casio FZ1
synth. It was originally designed in 2014. Only approx 30 of the
original units exist. With no plans to make anymore we have open
sourced the code, pcb design files (eagle) and a basic panel design so
others can make there own and add customisation's and/or improvements. We
are unable however to provide any support!

A built module features two filter cores A & B with voltage and direct
controlled resonance and cut off as well as a 'DCA' (a digital
controlled vca). There is also a mix output. Expect a weird murky
sounding filter which when modulated right can really squelch up nice.

You will need a donor 'MB87186' IC desolded from a real FZ1 or FZ1M
synth. They each contain 4 and the IC is usually marked 'FM1' with a
date code below. The IC then connects to the DIL socket on the rear of
the module.

For more information on the MB87186 (and from what much of the code
was based on) See http://www.buchty.net/casio/dcf.html

** Building and flashing the firmware

You'll need a basic 'usbtiny' AVR programmer.

You'll need to install avr-gcc and avrdude.

/(On mac using brew..)/
#+BEGIN_SRC
brew tap osx-cross/avr
brew install avr-gcc
brew install avrdude
#+END_SRC

Type 'make' in the firmare/ directory to make the source code and
then run './flash.sh' (with your programmer connected) to program the
Fizzle.
